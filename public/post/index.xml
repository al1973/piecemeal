      <description>Moby Dick is Herman Melville’s epic novel of 1851. It tells the story of Captain Ahab’s pursuit of a great white sperm whale that has bitten off his leg. He risks his own life and that of his crew on the whaling ship Pequod. He is gripped by a narcissistic rage in his single-minded voyage of revenge. The tale is narrated by Ishmael, taking part in his first whaling expedition, and we encounter a multi-national crew including Queequeg, Starbuck, Stubb, Tashtego, Flask and Daggoo.</description>
